Our design principles are the roots, the core, the foundation. All our design
decisions are based on the following principles.

#### Lean design, for slow Internet connections
Because UNICEF staff is working on many countries with slow Internet connections, every design has to be fast and nimble.

#### Design for all, no matter your tech savviness
Explicit and obvious design for all, because no matter how tech savvy you are, our apps shall be easy to use and understand. For example, we always display icons with labels, use the minimum amount of words that convey one single complete meaning, in case of doubt we prefer more words.

#### Accessible for all, regardless of disability
Because in UNICEF every single person is important, design shall be accessible for all.

#### Design is as little design as possible
Less, but better – because it concentrates on the essential aspects, and the apps are not burdened with non-essentials.

#### Consistent designs
In visual style, labeling, layouts and processes. Because we don’t reinvent the wheel in every project and users don’t need to learn new conventions for every tool.
But we understand we use a very diverse set of technologies. A best effort shall be approached.

#### Made by UNICEF
Because we love UNICEF, designs present UNICEF brand core values and principles, in a subtle and humble way.
